"battery": "To meet the 3-hour autonomy with a 60% Depth of Discharge (DoD), the required battery capacity is calculated as follows:

Usable battery capacity = (Energy consumption x Autonomy) / DoD Usable battery capacity = (1 kWh x 3 hours) / 0.6 = 5 kWh

Since the battery is 12V, the total battery capacity in Ah is:

Total Ah = Usable kWh / (Battery Voltage x DoD) Total Ah = 5000 Wh / 12V / .6 = 694.44Ah

Number of 200Ah batteries needed = Total Ah / Single Battery Ah Number of 200Ah batteries needed = 694.44 Ah / 200 Ah = ~3.47 So you need 4 (12V 200Ah) batteries connected to make it 24 volt system.

Therefore, at least 4 batteries are needed to meet the specified autonomy.", "panel": "Total power needed: 4kW Panel wattage: 500W Number of panels = Total Power / Panel Wattage Number of panels = 4000W / 500W = 8

Therefore, 8 panels are needed.", "inverter": "The inverter needs to handle the 4kW load and be compatible with a 24V battery system.

Inverter size: 4kW Inverter voltage: 24V

Select a 4kW, 24V inverter.", "charge controller": "With 8 x 500W panels, the total panel wattage is 4000W. For a 24V system:

I = P/V Current (I) = 4000/24= 166.67A

A charge controller with a minimum rating of 167A at 24V is needed.", "total": "8 panels, 4 batteries, 4kW 24V inverter, and 167A charge controller", "estimate": "Costs are greatly dependent on the specific brands, availability in your region, and installation costs. A rough order of magnitude estimate:

Panels: $800 - $2400 ( $100 - $300 per panel) Batteries: $800 - $2000 ($200-$500 per battery) Inverter: $400 - $1500 Charge Controller: $200 - $800 Cables, fuses, and other accessories: $100 - $500

Total (rough estimate): $2300 - $7200 (before installation). Professional installation can easily add $1000 - $3000 to the total cost.
